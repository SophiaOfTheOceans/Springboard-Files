# Springboard-Files

This respository contains all code, data, and files related to my work in the Springboard Data Science Career Track. Below is a table of contents for the work I did, with a brief description of the each respective work cited.

# Capstone 1:
## Prediction of skin cancer using images from the HAM10000 dataset
I classified images of skin conditions to one of seven possible diagnoses using patient information and image features extracted with VGG16.

Key skills:
* Use of VGG as an image feature extractor.
* Hyperparameter optimization.
* Implementing scikit-learn and custom-built Keras classification models.
* Imputing missing values with RandomForest.

# Mini Projects
## Data acquisition:
### JSON
Exercise in JSON data exploration and extraction.

Key skills:
* JSON manipulation
* Data charting and visualization

### SQL
Exercise in data querying from MySQL database.

Key skills:
* SQL querying

### API
Stock data acquition using Quandl API and basic summary statistics using numpy.

Key skills:
* Quandl API querying

----
## Exploratory data analysis:
### Human temperature data
Using bootstrap and frequentist approaches, I determined the true average human body temperature and compared it between males and females.

### Hospital readmittance
I statistically analyzed the relationship between the size of a hospital and its readmission rate, and critiqued the conclusion of a previously done study using the information.

### Racial discrimination
I used bootstrap and frequentist hypothesis testing to determine if race is a statistically significant factor in job interviews.

Key skills:
* Statistical analysis
* Central Limit Theorem
* Frequentist, Bayesian, and Bootstrap hypothesis testing
* t- and z- tests.
* Data manipulation in Pandas
* Python programming
* Data charting and visualizaiton.

----
## Supervised machine learning:
### Linear regression
In the Boston Housing Dataset, I analyzed several factors' impact on housing prices and made predictions using linear regression.

Key skills:
* Linear Regression using scikit-learn and statsmodels
* Interpretation of F and T-values.

### Logistic regression
Classified each weight-height combination as male/female using logistic regression.

Key skills:
* Logistic Regression

### Naive Bayes
Vectorized critic reviews from RottenTomatos, classified each review as "fresh" or "not fresh" using a Naive Bayes Classifier, and determined what words were most predictive of "freshness".

Key skills:
* Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
* Text vectorization
* Sparse arrays
* Cross-validation

----
## Unsupervised machine learning:
### KMeans clustering
Used KMeans to cluster wine customer data, performed dimensionality reduction using PCA, and analyzed, as well as compared, cluster tightness with other clustering algorithms (Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN, etc) using silhouette scores.

Key skills:
* KMeans
* PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
* Selecting PCA components using explained variance (the elbow method).
* Analyzed cluster tightness using Silhouette scores.
